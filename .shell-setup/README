### SETUP
-----

Run the following commands to setup the bare git repo, this puts all the git files in the top level and is used when
edits are not being made in the actual repo folder.

Next an alias is created so you can call 'config status' instead of git status.

This is used to set the showUntrackedFiles to no so files we don't care about won't show in the status command.

Then it is pushed into the zshrc file for global use.

[code]
git init --bare $HOME/.cfg
alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/ --work-tree=$HOME'
config config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
echo "alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/ --work-tree=$HOME'" >> $HOME/.zshrc

### REPO
The repo name is shell-setup
